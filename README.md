The "A_16_mVQA_code_files" folder consists 5 code files:

--> Out of which 4 are PYTORCH codes files (Uses Pytorch library):

1) vgg16_reset50_BiLSTM.ipynb --> Uses In-Built VGG16 & ResNet50 for extracting Image Features and Bi LSTM for extracting Text Features. 
2) cnn_BiLSTM.ipynb	      --> Uses Custom CNN for extracting Image Features and Bi LSTM for extracting Text Features.
3) cnn_BiLSTM_MHAM.ipynb      --> Uses Custom CNN for extracting Image Features and Bi LSTM with Multi Head attention for extracting Text Features.
4) cnn_LSTM_SAM.ipynb         --> Uses Custom CNN for extracting Image Features and LSTM with Self Attention for extracting Text Features.


--> Another code file named "A_16_mVQA_tensor.ipynb" is for REFERENCE code file which includes all the above model executed in a single file but using TENSORFLOW library.
